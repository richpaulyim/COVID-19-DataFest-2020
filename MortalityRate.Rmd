library(ggplot2)

global = read.csv("covidData_clean.csv")
global = global %>% mutate(rate = 100 * total_deaths / total_cases) #create column for mortality rate
global$rate[is.na(global$rate)]<-0
origin <- as.Date("2019-12-31")
global = global %>% mutate(days_since = as.Date(date) - origin) #create column for days since 12/31/2019, the start of our data

narrowed = global %>% filter(location == "World" | iso_code == "USA")

#as.Date("2020-03-11") - as.Date("2019-12-31") returns 71 days, which is the time between the start of the data and when the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic
